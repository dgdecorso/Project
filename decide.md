## Decison Matrix 

Before we started making the game, we both had to decide on what game engine were going to use. We agreed on GODOT because Leon already has a little bit Experience on it. We didnt have any problems deciding what Engine we use to program the website, because we only know VS studio Code.

<ul>
<li>Experience</li>
<p>We agreed on that the Experince is the most important thing, because we dont have to learn anything or less things </p>
  
<li>Programming Language</li>
<p>It was important that we knew at least a little bit of one of the languages, so we wouldn't habe that many problems.</p>

<li>Easy to Develop</li>
<p> We wanted The programming language to be easy to develop a game. After we did some research we decided c would be easier.</p>

<li>Community</li>
<p>We needed to learn more about the language communities. We figured out that C is very good for programming games and that it wouldn't be too hard. Java Script is more of the Webbdesign langauage, which we didnt need.</p></p>

<li>Prior Experiences</li>
<p>It was very important to us that we choose a langauge where we would already have some experiences. It is much easier to programm something in this way.</p>
