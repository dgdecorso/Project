## Tools 

#### VS Studio Code
<p> We needed to download and install VS Code, so we could start programming our game. </p>

#### GitHub
<p> GitHub is an app, where we can push and commit codes or open repositories. We need GitHub, so our Teacher can take a look at our project, and so we can save all our things.  </p>

#### Google-/drive/docs
<p> We had to use Google to do some research about our code, and we had to use Google Drive/Docs because we needed to fill out some documents our Teacher gave us. </p>

#### Excel
<p> In Excel, we did all of our tables. </p>

<ul>
<li> Where is the mistake in our code?</li>
<li> Why isn't our code working? </li>
<li> Why istn't our computer always thinking logical?</li>
</ul>
