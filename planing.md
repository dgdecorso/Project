# Planing: 

<ul><li> Our Teacher gave us a few documents to fill in, so we did that first. We had to fill out an Assignment Brief, where we documented our Goals and our milestones. On Excel, we did a Timetable. 
On our Timetable, we noted which days we can work on our project and how long we can work on it. Together we also had to do a Task list. We discussed long about who was going to do which task, but in the end, we came to a very fair decision. 
Fabiano would do most of the programming, while Leona would do most of the Documentation. Besides these tasks, we also had to do a Table, where we needed to write down what we should do, in the worst-case scenario. We also tried not to make our goals too big, because we didn't want to not be able to achieve them and put ourselves under stress. </li></ul>

## How was our Plan made

<p> As soon as we decided what project we wanted to do, and we did the informing, we started planning. We first started to write down all the things that needed to be done (Documentation, Coding, Finalizing, Accepting, and all the other things.). After we got a list done with all the things we think are important, we started to arrange them into an order of "What is the most important" to "What is less important". In the end, we showed the list to our Teacher, and after he approved it we started working.</p>

## Milestones
We have discussed and decided on a few Milesotnes. 

<ul>
  <li> Coding Complete </li>
  <p> Our Code should be done for the first time. Without any finalizing or any perfectionating.</p>
  <li> Start Testing </li>
  <p> We want to start testing very soon after our Code is done because we have many different testing protocols, and we also want some of our friends/family members to test it</p>
  <li> Stop Testing </li>
  <p> After we tested we also want to be done with it, because being done with the testing means being very close to being finished with our project.</p>
  <li>Finalize the code and Docuemtation</li>
  <p> After we stopped testing, it was time to finalize our code. Changing/adding some small details to our code. After we did this we can say that the Documentation is also nearly done. </p>
  <li> Accepted </li>
  <p> As soon as all the other Milestones are completed it is time that we accept the way our code and our documentation are. We need to accept the way it turned out.</p>
  
</ul>

## Managing our Time

<p> Luckily, we had a great timetable. There were some days we couldn't work as we planned, but we decided to work on other days more. Also, we were lucky that Fabiano knew about going to Holidays soon enough, so we could include that into our time. Till now, we never had any complications with our Time management. Since we both made a task list in the beginning, we could plan everything smoothly. The only mistake we made was that we didn't plan time for including our Feedback in our Project. Needing to make some differences to your project also takes up time, which we forgot to include. Luckily we currently have Holidays and at work, we are sometimes allowed to work on our Project, so we do the updating there. </p>
